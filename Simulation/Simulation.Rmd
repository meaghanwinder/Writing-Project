```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

GOAL: write out an occupancy model and simulate data with various parameters to understand the process

$M$ sites sampled $J$ times
for now, assume $p$ is constant
observations $y_{i,j}$, $i = 1, 2, \dots, M$, $j =  1, 2, \dots, J$

```{r}
set.seed(10152019)
p <- 0.6
psi <- 0.6
M <- 10 #number of sites
J <- 8 #number of samples per site... this does not need to be the same for all sites

z <- rbinom(M, 1, psi) #site occupancy, can include covariates at this level if they impact the probability of occupancy of a site, here psi is constant for all sites
y <- rbinom(M, J, p*z)
```
