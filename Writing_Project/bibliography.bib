   annotate = {The authors, Stephen Brooks and Andrew Gelman, review the univariate method for assessing MCMC convergence proposed by Gelman and Rubin (1992). This method assumes m are run in parallel from different starting points; the variability within each chain is then compared to the variability between each chain in an ANOVA like procedure. The authors then discuss a multivariate extension to this statistic, the Gelman-Rubin statistic. The statistic is applied to a few different examples and shown to work well. },

abstract="Unique parametrizations of models are very important for parameter interpretation and consistency of estimators. In this paper we analyze the identifiability of a general class of finite mixtures of multinomial logits with varying and fixed effects, which includes the popular multinomial logit and conditional logit models. The application of the general identifiability conditions is demonstrated on several important special cases and relations to previously established results are discussed. The main results are illustrated with a simulation study using artificial data and a marketing dataset of brand choices.",
